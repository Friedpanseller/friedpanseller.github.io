## 2025 NSW Government CTF
### Your First Flag

Your First Flag and maybe even at your first CTF!!

You'll find that the challenges will require proof that you solved it, which is called a "flag". Sometimes a challenge will ask you to wrap the answer in flag{...}, though in all cases the challenge description will tell you what to do. Good luck and have fun!

Can you copy and paste this flag?

### Journey  

Literally `flag{1_can_c0py_and_past3}` in the description. Nothing special.
